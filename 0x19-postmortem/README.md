# Issue Summary
Duration of Outage:
Start: August 15, 2024, 03:00 UTC
End: August 15, 2024, 04:30 UTC

# Impact:
During the 1.5-hour outage, approximately 60% of users experienced significant delays when attempting to load our main web application. Some users faced complete downtime, particularly those in the Asia-Pacific region. The affected services included user authentication and database queries, leading to failed logins and unresponsive pages.

# Root Cause:
The root cause of the issue was a misconfiguration in the load balancer after a recent update. This misconfiguration caused an uneven distribution of traffic, leading to an overload on one of the primary database servers.

# Timeline
03:00 UTC - Monitoring alerts triggered due to high latency and increased error rates on the web application.
03:05 UTC - On-call engineer noticed the issue and began initial diagnostics.
03:15 UTC - Assumed root cause was a sudden spike in traffic, and scaling measures were initiated.
03:30 UTC - Issue escalated to the database and networking teams as traffic scaling did not resolve the problem.
03:45 UTC - Misleading diagnostics led the team to suspect a database corruption issue; data integrity checks were performed.
04:00 UTC - Load balancer misconfiguration was identified as the likely cause by the networking team.
04:15 UTC - Load balancer configuration was corrected, redistributing traffic evenly across all servers.
04:30 UTC - Service fully restored; monitoring confirmed normal operations.
Root Cause and Resolution
The outage was caused by a misconfiguration in the load balancer settings following a routine update. The update inadvertently altered the traffic distribution rules, leading to a situation where one database server was overwhelmed while others remained underutilized. The systemâ€™s redundancy measures were insufficient to compensate for the imbalance, resulting in degraded performance and, in some cases, complete service outages for a significant portion of users.

Once the load balancer misconfiguration was identified, the networking team adjusted the settings to restore balanced traffic distribution. Following this, the system gradually returned to normal operations, and all users were able to access the services without further issues.

Corrective and Preventative Measures
To prevent similar incidents in the future, the following actions will be taken:

Improve Load Balancer Update Procedures: Review and refine the update procedures for load balancer configurations, ensuring that all changes are thoroughly tested in a staging environment before being applied to production.
Enhanced Monitoring: Implement more granular monitoring on load balancer traffic distribution to detect imbalances sooner.
Automated Traffic Redistribution: Develop automated scripts that can rebalance traffic in real-time in case of a server overload.
Training: Conduct additional training sessions for the operations team on the impact of load balancer configurations and best practices for handling similar issues.
Post-Update Validation: Introduce a mandatory post-update validation checklist that includes testing for proper load distribution and server health.
These measures will be implemented over the next two weeks to ensure that similar issues are mitigated in the future.
